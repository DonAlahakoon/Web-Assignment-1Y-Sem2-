                  <h1>1.Leave the car at home.</h1>
                  <p>Instead of getting in the car, walk or cycle – and enjoy the physical and mental health benefits, and the money saved. For longer journeys, use public transport, or try car sharing schemes.
                    <br>
                   Not only do cars contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, but air pollution caused by exhaust fumes from traffic poses a serious threat to public health. It has been shown to affect the health of unborn babies and increase the risk of dementia.</p>

                  <h1>2.Respect and Protect green spaces</h1>
                  <p>Green spaces, such as parks and gardens, are important. They absorb carbon dioxide and are associated with lower levels of air pollution.

                    They help to regulate temperature by cooling overheated urban areas, can reduce flood risk by absorbing surface rainwater and can provide important habitats for a wide variety of insects, animals, birds and amphibians.

                    They also provide multiple benefits to public health, with studies linking green space to reduced levels of stress.

                  <h1>3.Cut consumption and waste</h1>
                  <p>Everything we use as consumers has a carbon footprint.

                  Avoid single-use items and fast fashion, and try not to buy more than you need.

                  Shop around for second-hand or quality items that last a long time.

                  Put your purchasing power to good use by choosing brands that align with your new green aspirations. </p>

                  <h1>4.Reduce,reuse and recycle</h1>
                  <p>Cut down on what you throw away. Follow the three "R's" to conserve natural resources and landfill space.
                  Your environmental footprint goes beyond energy use and your business. All of the materials and equipment in your facility must be produced and shipped there, and then disposed of—all of which impacts the environment. Look for ways to use less; it could be something as simple as printing on both sides of paper or developing a better preventive maintenance program to make equipment last longer. Establish a companywide recycling program.</p>

                  <h1>5.Plant a tree</h1>
                  <p>Trees provide food and oxygen. They help save energy, clean the air, and help combat climate change.</p>

                  <h1>6.Use energy more efficiently</h1>
                  <p>Producing electricity and natural gas and delivering it to your door generates greenhouse gas emissions. Installing energy-efficient building systems and equipment can save energy and reduce your environmental footprint. See the Commercial or Industrial energy efficiency tools for recommendations that are tailored to your business segment.</p>

                  <h1>7.Skip the disposable items</h1>
                  <p>Single use plastics and items to skip include plastic water bottles, disposable utensils and coffee cups. Instead of using plastic water bottles, investing in a glass bottle such as The Bare Bottle is a good idea as they are made from eco-friendly stainless steel, which won’t hurt the environment and can be reused for years.
                    To take it a step further, you could even try the Plastic Free July challenge that’s happening across the world.</p>

                  <h1>8.Adopt water saving habits</h1>
                  <p>Take shorter showers, and if you need to wash your car, take it to the car wash - it uses significantly much less water than would be used at home, and the water is recycled.</p>

                  <p>There’s a mantra that says ‘leave only your footprints behind’, and it’s an idea that we should all live by wherever we go - especially at the beach or public spaces. If everyone was accountable for their waste, our planet would be litter free, greener, and healthier.</p>
